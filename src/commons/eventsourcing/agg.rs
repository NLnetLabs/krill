//------------ Aggregate -----------------------------------------------------

/// This trait defines an Aggregate for use with the event sourcing framwork.
///
/// An aggregate is term coming from DDD (Domain Driven Design) and is used to
/// describe an abstraction where a cluster of structs (the aggregate) provides
/// a 'bounded context' for functionality that is exposed only by a single top-level
/// struct: the aggregate root. Here we name this aggregate root simply 'Aggregate'
/// for brevity.
///
/// The aggregate root is responsible for guarding its own consistency. In the
/// context of the event sourcing framework this means that it can be sent a command,
/// through the [`process_command`] method. A command represents an intent to
/// achieve something sent by the used of the aggregate. The Aggregate will then take
/// this intent and decide whether it can be executed. If successful a number of
/// 'events' are returned that contain state changes to the aggregate. These events
/// still need to be applied to become persisted.
