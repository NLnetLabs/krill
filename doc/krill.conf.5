.TH "KRILL.CONF" "5" "Dec 04, 2025" "0.15.1-dev" "Krill"
.SH NAME
krill.conf \- Krill config
.SH INTRODUCTION
.sp
Krill can be tweaked using a lot of options in the config file. The config
file can be found in \fI/etc/krill.conf\fP\&. Default installations of Krill set
three options: \fIadmin_token\fP, \fIstorage_uri\fP, and \fIlog_type\fP\&. Changes to the
config file will be applied after Krill is restarted. Most of the time you
will not need to change any of these configuration variables. The
configuration file format is TOML. In short, it consists of a sequence of
key\-value pairs, each on its own line. Strings are to be enclosed in double
quotes. Lists can be given by enclosing a comma\-separated list of values in
square brackets.
.sp
\fBPlease note:\fP square brackets in TOML indicate a \fItable\fP\&. If you add e.g.
\fI[auth_users]\fP to your configuration, all options below it will be interpreted
as part of \fIauth_users\fP until another table is started. Any option that is not
part of a table (which is most options) should be defined before the first
table. Apart from that options are not dependent on their order.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fBip\fP
.sp
IP address(es) Krill listens to. By default Krill listens to 127.0.0.1.
We recommend that you keep this setting and use a proxy server such as NGINX
or Apache if you must make your Krill instance accessible remotely.
.sp
Can be set to one or more IP addresses, e.g.:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
ip = \(dq127.0.0.1\(dq
ip = [\(dq127.0.0.1\(dq, \(dq::1\(dq]
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBport\fP
.sp
Port number Krill listens on, by default 3000. This applies to all IP
addresses.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
port = 3000
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBhttps_mode\fP
.sp
Specify the HTTPS mode. Krill supports three modes:
.sp
\(dqgenerate\(dq (default)
.sp
Krill will generate a key pair and create a self\-signed certificate
if no previous key pair or certificate is found. File names used
are data_dir/ssl/key.pem and data_dir/ssl/cert.pem respectively.
.sp
\(dqexisting\(dq
.sp
Krill expects an existing key pair and certificate in the same
locations where it would otherwise store its generated key pair
and self\-signed certificate.
.sp
\(dqdisable\(dq
.sp
Krill will use plain HTTP.
.sp
This mode is not recommended as HTTPS adds little overhead, and
even with a self\-signed certificate provides better security
out of the box. We recommend STRONGLY that you do not use this
option if your Krill instance is configured to bind to a public
IP address.
.sp
Even if you use \(dqdisable\(dq here, Krill still insists on using HTTPS for its
service_uri. See below.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
https_mode = \(dqgenerate\(dq
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT

.sp
\fBunix_socket_enabled\fP
.sp
Whether UNIX socket support is enabled. By default this is true, unless you
are on a non\-UNIX system. This is the default way krillc communicates with
Krill.
.INDENT 0.0

.sp
.nf
.ft C
unix_socket_enabled = true
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBunix_socket\fP
.sp

started using the systemd service, this path may require root access. This
path is also used by default by krillc.

\fBstorage_uri\fP
.sp
The path to where Krill stores its data. Must be set. Please ensure only one
Krill instance uses this path. This path should be absolute. The default
for Krill installations is /var/lib/krill/data/
.INDENT 0.0

.ft C
storage_uri = \(dq/var/lib/krill/data/\(dq
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBuse_history_cache\fP
.sp
Krill keeps meta\-information on all past changes for each CA
and the Publication Server. This information is cached by default
to ensure that the history (audit log) API is fast.
.sp
However, this data can add up over time, so operators of
instances with many CAs or a lot of historical may choose
to turn this off to save memory. Note that memory will still
be used temporarily in case the history API is accessed.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp

.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBservice_uri\fP
.sp
Specify the base public service URI hostname and port.
.sp
The default service URI is set to \fI\%https://localhost:3000/\fP\&. This is fine
for setups where you use Krill to run your own CA only. You do not need to
set this to enable remote access to the UI or API (e.g. for using the CLI
remotely). Simply setting up a proxy suffices for this.
.sp
However, if you are serving as a parent CA or Publication Server that
needs to be accessible by remote CAs, then you will need to tell your
Krill instance what its public (base) URI will be, so that it can include
the proper URIs in responses to those CAs. HTTPS is required for this.
.sp
At present this MUST be an https URI with a hostname and optional port
number only. It is not allowed to use a Krill specific path prefix.
.sp
Make sure to include a backslash at the end.
.sp
Krill UI, API and service URIs will be derived as follows:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
<service_uri>api/v1/                   (api)

\fBadmin_token\fP
.sp
Define an admin token that can be used to interact with the API. This token is
used to access the Krill API and the Krill server when not using UNIX sockets.
.sp
If you do not specify a value here, the server will insist that you
provide a token as an environment variable with the key
\(dqKRILL_ADMIN_TOKEN\(dq.
.sp
Krill installations come with a randomly generated 32 character string as a
token. Krill does not enforce any password requirements but do think twice

\fBauth_openidconnect\fP
.sp
If \fBauth_type\fP is set to \(dqopenid\-connect\(dq, this provides the configuration for
OpenID connect that can then be used for connections. You will want to look at
\fI\%OpenID Connect Users\fP for details.
.sp
It provides the following fields:
.sp
\fIissuer_url\fP (Mandatory)
.sp
Provided by your OpenID Connect provider. This is the URL of the provider
discovery endpoint. \(dq/.well\-known/openid_configuration\(dq will be appended if not
present. Krill will fetch the OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0 compliant JSON when
starting. Krill will fail to start if the URL does not match the \(dqissuer\(dq value
in the discovery response or if the endpoint cannot be contacted.
.sp
\fIclient_id\fP (Mandatory)
.sp
Provided by your OpenID Connect provider.
.sp
\fIclient_secret\fP (Mandatory)
.sp
Provided by your OpenID Connect provider.
.sp
\fIinsecure\fP
.sp
Defaults to false. Setting to true disables verification of signatures from the
provider token ID endpoint. Setting this to true may allow attackers to modify
provider responses undetected. Strongly discouraged.
.sp
\fIextra_login_scopes\fP
.sp
Provider specific. Defaults to \(dq\(dq. A comma\-separated list of OAuth 2.0 scopes
passed when directing a user to login. Scopes request additional user details.
\(dqprofile\(dq commonly enables email and other personal details. If the provider
supports the \(dqemail\(dq scope, it is requested automatically.
.sp
\fIextra_login_params\fP
.sp
A \fI{ key=value, ... }\fP map of extra HTTP query parameters sent with the
authorization request. Supported params vary by provider. \fIprompt=login\fP is
sent automatically unless disabled via \fIprompt_for_login\fP\&. May also be
specified as a TOML table. Example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fIprompt_for_login\fP
.sp
Defaults to true. Setting to false disables sending \fIprompt=login\fP\&. Allows
specifying another prompt value through \fIextra_login_params\fP\&. Supported
values: \fInone\fP, \fIlogin\fP, \fIconsent\fP, \fIselect_account\fP\&.
.sp
\fIlogout_url\fP
.sp
A URL to redirect the user to for logout. Usually unnecessary if discovery
metadata provides logout details. Otherwise must be specified. If discovery
shows no supported logout mechanism and no \fIlogout_url\fP is set, Krill
redirects users to the UI index page to restart login.
.sp
\fIid_claims\fP
.sp
A list for extracting the user ID from claim values. Typically provided as TOML
array tables. If missing, the \fIemail\fP claim is used as the user ID.
.sp
\fIrole_claims\fP
.sp
A list for extracting the user role from claim values. Typically provided as

\fBroa_aggregate_threshold\fP
.sp
It is recommended that separate ROAs are used for each authorized prefix,
even though the RFC allows for multiple prefixes for the same ASN to be
combined on a single ROA object. The reason for this is that the ROA will
become invalid if any of the listed prefixes no longer appears on your
CA\(aqs certificate. Note that Krill will automatically clean up
over\-claiming ROAs when it finds that its resources have been shrunk, but
there is a possible time window where ROAs can be invalid before Krill
discovers the shrinkage.
.sp
This value sets at how many separate ROAs Krill will start aggregating them
into one big ROA. By default 100.
