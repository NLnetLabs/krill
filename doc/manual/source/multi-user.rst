    Checking the currently logged in user and user attributes

By default Krill requires users to authenticate using the configured secret
token, and actions in the event history are attributed to a client using the
secret token or to Krill itself.

Krill also supports authenticating users **of the web user interface** with
their own username and credentials. Actions taken by such logged in users are
attributed in the event history to their username.

To login users by username Krill must first be configured either with locally
defined user details and credentials, or with the details necessary to
interact with a separate `OpenID Connect <https://openid.net/connect/>`_
compliant identity provider system.

.. note:: Clients using the Krill REST API directly or via ``krillc`` cannot
          authenticate using named users, they can only authenticate using the
          secret token. If you need this capability `please let us know
