# Set the following to true to force Krill to always perform full rechecks
# of its data directories at startup. This is disabled by default because
# if can slow down startup significantly.
#
# By default Krill will do some basic checks at startup already, and if any
# errors are encountered force a full recovery automatically: Krill will try
# to load all its state in its internal memory cache at startup. If there are
# no errors in reloading the latest 'info' about the state, any surplus data
# will be assumed to be the result from an incompletely finished transaction - or -
# a data directory backup which was taken during a transaction. In either case
# additional data is discarded and the last (committed) state is recreated.
#
# Note that when a Krill Publication Server performs a recovery it will also
# execute an RRDP session reset. This ensures that relying parties will get
# a full and consistent set of data, even if this data may be old. Furthermore,
# Krill CAs will *always* verify with their Publication Server which files it
# publishes currently, and if it finds that there are any missing files they
# will send all needed updates.
#
# So, while a (forced) fallback to a prior state is not ideal, the CAs will
# in fact recover. However, it may take a while
