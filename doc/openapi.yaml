    # Introduction
    Welcome to the documentation for the Krill server API, a JSON based
    REST-like API for managing your Krill Certificate Authorities and
    Publishers. For more information read the [Krill documentation](https://rpki.readthedocs.io/en/latest/krill/).

    ## Clients
    To interact with a Krill server using this API, either:
    - Use the [Krill CLI](https://rpki.readthedocs.io/en/latest/krill/using-cli.html).
    - Load this API specification into the Swagger [editor](https://editor.swagger.io/)
      or [viewer](https://petstore.swagger.io/) and use it to submit requests to
      a Krill server via your browser.
    - Use an [OpenAPI 3 generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/generators.html)
      to generate client code based on this API specification.
    - Write your own client code that adheres to this specification.

    ## Versioning
    The API path includes a version. The idea is that we may add functionality,
    but will not introduce breaking changes to existing functionality. You may
    expect additional resources, and you may see additional data (JSON members)
    within resources. So, please make sure that you ignore what you don’t
    understand when using this API.

    ## References
    Information about many of the concepts and data types that Krill works with
    can be found in the following Internet standards documents:
    - [RFC 6492: A Protocol for Provisioning Resource Certificates](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6492)
    - [RFC 8181: A Publication Protocol for the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8181)
    - [RFC 8183: An Out-of-Band Setup Protocol for Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) Production Services](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8183)

    ## Feedback
    Please give feedback and report issues concerning this API specification by
    creating a [Krill GitHub issue](https://github.com/NLnetLabs/krill/issues/new).

    # Authentication
    All Krill API endpoints are protected by [HTTP Bearer Authentication](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/bearer-authentication/).
    To use the endpoints the client must supply an HTTP Authorization header of the form:
    ```
    Authorization: Bearer <KRILL AUTH TOKEN>
    ```
    The token to use is defined in the Krill server configuration. Do not include
    the '<>' brackets in the request. For more information consult the [Krill documentation](https://rpki.readthedocs.io/en/latest/krill/running.html#admin-token).

    # Errors
    The format of and level of detail included in error reports from a Krill
    server depend on the type of failure that occured:
    - **5XX/Server Errors:** This type of failure occurs within or is caused
      by the environment in which Krill operates, or by bugs within Krill
      itself. Examples include network issues, resource starvation, access
      denied to resources, etc. Such errors are outside the control of Krill
      and may result in HTTP 5XX errors from a proxy in front of Krill or from
      Krill itself, or could manifest themselves as TCP timeouts and/or
      connection failures.
    - **4XX/Client Errors:** This type of failure occurs when the input
      provided to Krill is incorrect, either due to user error, adherence by
      the client to incorrect Krill API specifications, or malicious activity.
      Krill responds with HTTP 4XX errors, where possible with a HTTP response
      body in JSON format consisting of an error code and error message.
      **Note:** Clients should decide which action to take based on the error
      code, not on the error message. Such errors have the following form:
      ```
      {
          "code": <integer>,
          "msg": "string"
      }
      ```

    Krill CAs can have 0 or more 'Resource Classes' under each of its (0 or
    more) parents. Krill CAs will talk to all of their parents regularly and
    ask them about their resource entitlements. Typically a CA will have one
    parent and receive all their resources in a single resource class, but it's
    also possible that resources are split into multiple resource classes.
    Krill CAs can also have multiple parents and have resource classes under
    each of them.

    When a krill CA first gets a resource class it will:
    - create a pending key pair
    - request a certificate

    The 'key state' of this resource class is then shown as type "Pending".

    When the CA receives a certificate for this new pair it will be promoted to
    "Active", and publishing of objects will start. I.e. the CA will start
    publishing a manifest and CRL, and any configured ROAs for which the
    prefixes are held by this class.

    Resource classes in the state 'Active' can be rolled. The following phases
    exist in a key roll:
    - RollPending
    - RollNew
    - RollOld

      description: |
        When adding a CA you need to choose a “handle”, essentially just a
        name. The term “handle” comes from RFC 8183 and is used in the
        communication protocol between CAs and CAs and publication servers.

        When a CA has been added, it is registered to publish locally in the
        Krill instance where it exists, but other than that it has no
        configuration yet. In order to do anything useful with a CA you will
        first have to add at least one parent to it, and then most likely some
        Route Authorizations and/or Child CAs.

      summary: Get the RFC 8183 Parent Response for a child.
      description: |
        To get the RFC 8183 Parent Response for a child, regardless of whether
        the parent knows the ID Cert.

        **Note:** You can use 'update child' to add a new ID cert to a child,
        however, this is a real corner case that can only happen if you
        mistakenly added a remote child as embedded, rather than using its
        RFC 8183 Child Request.

        For "embedded" CAs you will not need this parent response when you add
        the "embedded" parent.

          - Request new certificates with SIA entries pointing to the new
            locations.
          - (best effort) Clean up of the old repository.
        The new repository can be embedded, or remote. To use a remote
        repository, the RFC 8181 Repository Response must be encoded into JSON.

      description: |
        When a key roll is initiated the following steps are executed:
        - A new key pair is created in state 'pending'.
        - A resource certificate is requested for the new key.

        The resource class will now have state 'RollPending'

        However, you may not observe this for long, as the request is sent to
        the parent immediately, and as soon as a certificate is received for
        the new key, the state moves from 'RollPending' to 'RollNew' and a MFT
        and CRL are published for the new key. All other objects (ROAs,
        delegated certificates) are still published under the active key.

      summary: Finish a key roll.
      description: |
        According the RFC new keys can be activated only after 24 hours. In
        practice however, this can also be done sooner. The main thing to keep
        in mind is that is only done after the parent CA has *published* the
        new certificate for the 'new' key - which might be some time after you
        actually received the certificate.

        In short: it's best to perform this step 24 hours after initialising a
        key roll, but if your old key is really compromised then you should
        probably just go ahead and do this asap.

        When a key roll is finished, the following happens:
        - The state is moved from 'RollNew' to 'RollOld'.
        - The new key becomes 'active' and will now also publish ROAs and
          delegates certs.
        - The former 'active' key becomes 'old' and only publishes a manifest
          and CRL, but no other objects.
        - A revocation request for the 'old' key is created.

        This state is also easy to miss, because Krill will immediately (but
        asynchronously) send the revocation request to the applicable parent
        and when it receives confirmation that the key is revoked it will:
        - Withdraw the manifest and crl for that key.
        - Move the state to 'Active' (and forget the old key).
