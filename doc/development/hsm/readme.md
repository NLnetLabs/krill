# HSM Feature

HSM is a feature both in the sense that it adds the functionality to Krill for enabling support for
using external cryptographic tokens such as hardware security modules (HSMs), and in the sense that
the functionality is gated behind a Cargo feature of the same name.

The "hsm" Cargo feature is enabled by default.
