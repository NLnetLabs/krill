Krill Developer Documentation
=============================

> NOTE: If you are looking for Krill user or operational documentation, please have
> a look [here](https://rpki.readthedocs.io/en/latest/krill/index.html).

This documentation is aimed at providing Developers at NLnet Labs insight into how the
core Krill code works. But there are no secrets here, so anyone with a healthy interest
in the guts of this Krill species is welcome to have a look.

This is still a work-in-progress. The plan is to have separate chapters which explain
components and/or concepts in Krill: 

1. [Krill Daemon Code](./01_daemon.md)
2. [Krill CLI Code](./02_cli.md)
3. [Event Sourcing General Overview](./03_es_concepts.md)
4. [Event Sourcing in Krill](./04_es_krill.md)
5. [Repository Manager](./05_repo_manager.md)
6. [Certificate Authority Manager](./06_ca_manager.md)
7. [Multi-User Feature](./multi-user/readme.md)
