# Krill Developer Documentation

> NOTE: If you are looking for Krill user or operational documentation, please have
> a look [here](https://rpki.readthedocs.io/en/latest/krill/index.html).

This documentation is aimed at providing Developers at NLnet Labs insight into how the
core Krill code works. But there are no secrets here, so anyone with a healthy interest
in the guts of this Krill species is welcome to have a look.

This is still a work-in-progress. The plan is to have separate chapters which explain
components and/or concepts in Krill: 


1. [Krill Daemon Code](./01_daemon.md)
2. [Krill CLI Code](./02_cli.md)
