.SH DESCRIPTION
Krill is a free, open source RPKI Certificate Authority that lets you run
delegated RPKI under one or multiple Regional Internet Registries (RIRs). 
Through its built-in publication server, Krill can publish Route Origin
Authorizations (ROAs) on your own servers or with a third party.

The krillup tool can be used to reduce the risk and time needed for Krill
upgrades, by preparing and verifying any data migrations that would be
needed. The data_dir setting from the provided configuration file is used to
find the data to migrate, and prepared data will be saved under
\'data_dir/upgrade-data\'.
