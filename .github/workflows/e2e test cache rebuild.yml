# The krillbuildbase image is used by the Krill E2E Test to accelerate the Rust compilation of Krill
# by including already built cargo crates for most if not all of Krills dependencies. We don't need
# to rebuild it all the time, but rebuilding it every now and again helps to keep the build time down.
# Ideally we'd use a different approach, e.g. some way of using a Rust build cache from within the
# Docker image build process, but for now we have this.
