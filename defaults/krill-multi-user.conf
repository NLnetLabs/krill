#
#                 Global auth(entication & authorization) settings
#
# These control which auth provider in Krill will be used to authenticate users
# and settings common to all auth providers. See below for more details.
#
# auth_type = "master-token"
# auth_policies = ["...", ...]
# auth_private_attributes = ["...", ...]


# Auth type (optional)
#
# Which provider to use for authentication (AuthN), authorization (AuthZ) and
# identity (ID). Also affects which login form the Krill web UI displays, or
# (in the case of auth_type = "openid-connect") the user is redirected to.
#
# Supported values: "master-token" (default), "config-file" or "openid-connect".
#
# At-a-glance comparison:
# =======================
#   Setting Value     AuthN       AuthZ           ID
#   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   "master-token"    auth_token  role = "admin"  id = "master-token"
#   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   "openid-connect"  provider    provider        provider
#                     checked     supplied        supplied
#   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   "config-file"     values are taken from the [auth_users] section in this
#                     config file
#   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# NOTE: At present the master-token provider is used as a fallback provider
# when using "openid-connect" or "config-file" as the primary provider. This is
# to ensure that krillc, which uses master-token authentication, is still able
# to communicate with the krill daemon.
#
### auth_type = "master-token"


# Auth policies (optional)
#
# One or more paths to external authorization policy files to use in addition to
# those built-in to Krill. The files must be in Oso Polar format [*1] and are
# loaded after the built-in Krill policies.
#
# Custom authorization policies are intended to handle requirements that are too
# complex for just the settings available in krill.conf and is an advanced
# topic beyond the scope of this documentation.
#
# The built-in policies treat the following user attributes specially:
#
#   - "role"    - One of "admin", "readwrite" or "readonly". See the full Krill
#                 documentation for more information about which permissions are
#                 associated with each role.
#   - "inc_cas" - A comma-separated set of CA handles which should be included
#                 in the set the user is permitted to see. If present this
#                 attribute will prevent the user seeing or interacting with any
#                 CA handle that is not in this set.
#   - "exc_cas" - A comma-separated set of CA handles which should be excluded
#                 from the set the user is permitted to see. Overrides inc_cas.
#                 If inc_cas is not set, any CA handle NOT in exc_cas will be
#                 visible to the user who may interact with it according to
#                 the permissions granted to the user (e.g. through a role
#                 assignment).
#
# Note: The inc_cas and exc_cas settings only restrict visibility of and
# interaction with specified CAs via the Krill web UI. CA handles are still
# visible in the repository content and metrics output by Krill.

#
### auth_policies = ["...", ...]


# Auth private attributes (optional)
#
# Zero or more user attributes that should not be revealed by (or even sent to)
# the Krill web UI. For example, you may wish to hide "exc_cas" so that a user
# doesn't know which CAs they are prevented from seeing!
#
### auth_private_attributes = ["...", ...]


# Config File auth provider details (mandatory when auth_type = "config-file")
#
# The Config File auth provider allows you to define one or more users which can
# then be used to login to the Krill web UI.
#
# Example:
#   auth_type = "config-file"
#
#   [auth_users]
#   "joe@example.com" = { attributes={ role="admin", exc_cas="ca1" }, password_hash="..." }
#
# Syntax:
#   auth_users = { "some id" = { ... } [, "another id" = { ... }, ...] }
#
# Alternative syntax:
#  [auth_users]
#  "some id" = { ... }
#  "another id" = { ... }
#
# Where { ... } can contain the following fields:
#
#   Field          Mandatory?  Notes
#   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   id             Yes         Email address or other identifier for the user.
#                              To be entered in the username form field in the
#                              web UI when logging in. Also shown in the Krill
#                              event history as the actor to which the action is
#                              attributed.
#
#   password_hash  Yes         Generate this value using the 'krillc config user'
#                              command on the command line. The web UI will hash
#                              the password entered in the login form and submit
#                              it to Krill for comparison to this hash, thereby
#                              ensuring that passwords are neither transmitted
#                              nor persisted.
#
#   attributes     No          Zero or more key=value pairs, e.g. role="admin".
#                              The built-in authorization policy (see above)
#                              requires a role attribute with value "admin",
#                              "readonly" or "readwrite". Attribute key=value
#                              pairs may be displayed by the Krill web UI. To
#                              prevent attributes being sent to the UI, use the
#                              auth_private_attributes setting (see above).

# OpenID Connect auth provider details (mandatory when auth_type = "openid-connect")
#
# The OpenID Connect auth provider delegates authentication of users to an
# external provider that implements the OpenID Connect Core 1.0 specification.
# It can also optionally retrieve user attributes (known as "claims" [*1]) from
# the provider, or from an [auth_users] section in the Krill configuration file.
#
# Syntax:
#   auth_openidconnect = { issuer_url="...", client_id="...", client_secret="..." }
#
# Alternative syntax:
#   [auth_openidconnect]
#   issuer_url = "..."
#   client_id = "..."
#   client_secret = "..."
#   insecure = false
#   extra_login_scopes = ["...", ...]
#   extra_login_params = ["...", ...]
#   logout_url = "..."
#
#   [auth_openidconnect.claims]
#   ...
#
# Where { ... } can contain the following fields:
#
#   (Sub)Field     Mandatory?  Notes
#   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   issuer_url          Yes    Provided by your OpenID Connect provider. This is
#                              the URL of the OpenID Connect provider discovery
#                              endpoint. "/.well-known/openid_configuration"
#                              will be appended if not present. Krill will fetch
#                              the OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0 compliant JSON
#                              response from this URL when Krill starts up. If
#                              this URL does not match the "issuer" value in the
#                              discovery endpoint response or if the discovery
#                              endpoint cannot be contacted, Krill will fail to
#                              start.
#
#   client_id           Yes    Provided by your OpenID Connect provider.
#
#   client_secret       Yes    Provided by your OpenID Connect provider.
#
#   insecure            No     Defaults to false. Setting this to true will
#                              disable verification of the signature of the
#                              OpenID Connect provider token ID endpoint
#                              response. Setting this to false may allow attackers
#                              to modify responses from the provider without
#                              being detected. Setting this to false is strongly
#                              discouraged.
#
#   extra_login_scopes  No     Provider specific. Defaults to "". A
#                              comma-separated list of OAuth 2.0 scopes to be
#                              passed to the provider when a user is directed to
#                              login with the provider. Scopes are typically
#                              used to instruct the provider to send additional
#                              user details along with provider token responses.
#                              One common scope is "profile" which often causes
#                              the server to respond with email addresses and
#                              other personal details about the user. If the
#                              OpenID Connect provider discovery endpoint shows
#                              that "email" is a supported scope then the "email"
#                              scope will be requested automatically, you don't
#                              need to specify it here in that case.
#
#   extra_login_params  No     A { key=value, ... } map of additional HTTP query
#                              parameters to send with the authorization request
#                              to the provider when redirecting the user to the
#                              OpenID Connect provider login form. Section
#                              3.1.2.1. Authentication Request in the OpenID
#                              Connect Core 1.0 specification [*2] lists various
#                              parameters that can be sent but the supported set
#                              varies by provider. The prompt=login parameter is
#                              automatically sent by the provider and thus does
#                              not need to be provided using this setting. Can
#                              also be specified as a separate TOML table, e.g.:
#
#                                [openid_connect.extra_login_params]
#                                display=popup
#                                ui_locales="fr-CA fr en"
#
#   logout_url          No     A URL to direct the browser to redirect the user
#                              to in order to logout. Ideally this is not needed
#                              as the provider OpenID Connect Discovery response
#                              should contain the details Krill needs, but for
#                              some providers a logout_url must be specified
#                              explicitly. If the provider discovery response
#                              doesn't announce support for any supported
#                              mechanisms and no logout_url value is set then
#                              Krill will default to directing the user back to
#                              the Krill UI index page from where the user will
#                              be directed to login again via the OpenID Connect
#                              provider.

#                              in the Krill web UI and can be tested by the
#                              authorization policy.. Can also be specified as
#                              a separate TOML table, e.g.:
#
#                                [openid_connect.claims]
#                                name  = { source="...", jmespath="...", dest="..."}
#                                name2 = { ... }
#
#                              An "id" claim is required. If not specified the
#                              following default "id" claim configuration will
#                              be used:
#
#                                id = { jmespath="email" }
#
#                              To prevent attributes being sent to the UI, use
#                              the auth_private_attributes setting (see above).
#
#         source               If the 'source' subfield is not provided, all
#                              available token and userinfo claim responses from
#                              the OpenID Connect provider will be searched for
#                              a field that matches the 'jmespath' expression.
#
#                              If specified the value identifies a specific
#                              claim set to search and can be one of the
#                              following values:
#
#                                config-file
#                                id-token-standard-claim
#                                id-token-additional-claim
#                                user-info-standard-claim
#                                user-info-additional-claim
#
#                              The source = "config-file" value is special, it
#                              doesn't refer to an OpenID Connect provider
#                              response claim set but rather to user attributes
#                              looked up using the "id" claim value as a key to
#                              index into the [auth_users] user attribute map.
#
#                              The "id" claim value cannot therefore itself be
#                              taken from [auth_users], and password_hash values
#                              in [auth_users] are ignored as authentication is
#                              handled by the OpenID Connect provider.
#
#         dest                 The optional "dest" field can be used to set the
#                              value of an attribute by a different name than
#                              the claims key used. This can be used to specify
#                              multiple claim rules that attempt to extract a
#                              a value for the same claim. The first matching
#                              rule in such cases will be used.
#
#         jmespath             The "jmespath" field specifies a JMESPath [*5]
#                              expression which is used to find a matching field
#                              in the OpenID Connect provider JSON response. In
#                              addition to the standard JMESPath functions the
#                              Krill implementation includes two custom regular
#                              expression based functions to match and
#                              optionally replace parts of the value of the
#                              fieldm matched by the JMESPath expression. These
#                              two functions are:
#
#                                recap(<field name/value>, 'capturing regex')
#                                resub(<field name/value>, 'search regex', replace'))
#
#                              With these extra functions cases where part of a
#                              complex string should be matched, extacted and
#                              (with resub) mapped to a value that matches what
#                              the authorization policy expects. E.g. it could
#                              be used to match a substring and then to "output"
#                              a particular Krill role name.
#
#                              If the combination of "resub()" and "dest" is
#                              not powerful enough you can take value matching
#                              even further using policy file rules. "dest" and
#                              "resub" may be combined with policy file rules in
#                              order to simplify the policy file rules needed.
#
#                              When determining the right "jmespath" expression
#                              to use, match failures will be logged at "info"
#                              level (as the auth policy in use may not require
#                              all configured claims to be found for all users)
#                              including a list of claims that are available to
#                              match. Additionally at "debug" level details
#                              about the claim search process are logged and at
#                              "trace" level the OpenID HTTP Connect provider
#                              HTTP/JSON responses are logged.
#
#                              Escaping: If you need to use double quotes to
#                              escape a JMESPath identifier you will need to use
#                              jmespath='...' or jmespath='''...''' instead of
#                              jmespath="..." in the Krill configuration file.
#                              See the JMESPath [*6] and TOML [*7] specs for 
#                              more information about quoting and escaping.

# Registering Krill with an OpenID Connect provider:
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# In order to communicate with an OpenID Connect provider, Krill must first be
# registered with that provider. As a result of registration you will be issued
# a client_id and a client_secret, and possibly also an issuer_url (or you may
# have to consult the provider documentation to determine the issuer_url).
#
# When registering you will usually need to specify a callback URL. For Krill
# this should be <service_uri>auth/callback (replace <service_uri> with the
# actual value set above).
#
# When auth_type = "openid-connect" the client details MUST be provided to Krill
# via settings in the [auth_openidconnect] section of the configuration file.
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Required OpenID Connect provider capabilities:
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The OpenID Connect provider must implement the following specifications:
#
#         https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html
#         https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html
#         https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-rpinitiated-1_0.html
#
# At the issuer_url endpoint the provider MUST announce support for at least the
# following:
#
#   "issuer": ".."
#   "authorization_endpoint": "..",
#   "token_endpoint": "..", ("userinfo_endpoint" is also supported if available)
#   "jkws_uri": "..",
#   "scopes_supported": ["openid"]
#   "response_types_supported": ["code"]
#   "response_modes_supported": ["query"]
#   "grant_types_supported": ["authorization_code"]
#   "id_token_signing_alg_values_supported": ["RS256"]
#   one of: "end_session_endpoint": ".." or "revocation_endpoint": ".."
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# A note about HTTPS certificates:
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# If the provider URLS are HTTPS URLs (which they should be unless this
# deployment of Krill is only for testing) then the HTTPS certificate must have
# been issued by a CA in the O/S CA certificate store, i.e. either a well known
# authority that is included in the store by default, or a custom CA that you
# have added to the store yourself. Krill will fail to connect to a provider
# that uses a self-signed certificate or a certificate from an unknown root
# certificate authority. For more information see for example:
# http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/xenial/man8/update-ca-certificates.8.html
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# A note about end_session_endpoint and revocation_endpoint:
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# "end_session_endpoint" is defined by various [*1] OpenID Connect draft
# specifications relating to logout. In Krill it is used for the purpose defined
# in the OpenID Connect RP-Initiated Logout 1.0 spec [*1], namely for Krill as
# the RP (OpenID Connect terms Krill a Relying Party in this context, which is
# particularly confusing given that the term Relying Party also has meaning in
# Krill's native RPKI domain) to be able to initiate logout of the user at the
# provider. Krill also requires that the endpoint either honours the
# "post_logout_redirect_uri" HTTP query parameter (defined as OPTIONAL in the
# spec) or that the provider can be configured with corresponding behaviour,
# i.e. to redirect the end-user user-agent (browser) back to Krill after logout
# is completed at the provider. If support for this is lacking it is undefined
# where the user will end up after logout, which is not an issue if the user
# was finished with Krill, but is annoying if the logout was done in order to
# re-login to Krill as a different user. At least one provider has been observed
# which does NOT support this endpoint.
#
# As an alternative Krill also supports "revocation_endpoint"
# (see https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7009 "OAuth 2.0 Token Revocation") which
# is used to terminate the users login session at the provider without leaving
# the Krill web UI.
#
# Finally if neither of these mechanisms are supported a logout_url can be
# specified explicitly via configuration.

# Example RedHat KeyCloak configuration:
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This example is for a local test deployment of RedHat KeyCloak:
#
#   [auth_openidconnect]
#   issuer_url = "http://localhost:8082/auth/realms/myrealm"
#   client_id = "krill"
#   client_secret = "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
#
# That's it! For this to work you must already have configured your KeyCloak
# instance e.g. with a realm, client (with redirect URI set), users and an
# attribute mapper (to expose a custom user attribute as a "role" claim) and a
# "role" attribute for each user.
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Example Azure Active Directory configuration:
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This example is for a Microsoft Azure cloud Active Directory instance that
# permits only read-only and read-write access to users that login via the Krill
# web UI:
#
#   [auth_openidconnect]
#   issuer_url = "https://login.microsoftonline.com/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/v2.0"
#   client_id = "yyyyyyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyyyyyyyyyy"
#   client_secret = "zzzzzzzz"
#   extra_login_scopes = ["offline_access"]
#
#   [auth_openidconnect.claims]
#   id = { jmespath="name" }
#   ro_role = { jmespath="resub(roles[?@ == 'gggggggg-gggg-gggg-gggg-gggggggggggg'] | [0], '^.+$', 'readonly')", dest="role" }
#   rw_role = { jmespath="resub(roles[?@ == 'hhhhhhhh-hhhh-hhhh-hhhh-hhhhhhhhhhhh'] | [0], '^.+$', 'readwrite')", dest="role" }
#
# For this to work you must already have configured in the Azure portal your AD
# tenant, app registration and enterprise application settings (with redirect
# URI), users, group assignments and optional claim configuration (in the above
# example AD was configured to expose groups as roles).
#
# The JMESPath expression matches on Azure AD group GUID values, taking the
# first match it finds and then setting the "role" attribute to either readonly
# or readwrite depending on which GUID was matched. The GUIDs for your groups
# will be different than those used in this example, see your Krill log for the
# GUIDs to match on.
#
# The offline_access scope is required in order to trigger Azure Active
# Directory to issue a refresh token to Krill.
#

# Example Amazon Web Services Cognito configuration:
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   [auth_openidconnect]
#   issuer_url = "https://cognito-idp.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/eu-central-1_xxxxxxx"
#   client_id = "yyyyyyyy"
#   client_secret = "zzzzzzzz"
#   logout_url = "https://dddddddd.auth.eu-central-1.amazoncognito.com/logout?client_id=yyyyyyyy&logout_uri=https://your.krill.domain/"
#
#   [auth_openidconnect.claims]
#   role = { jmespath='''resub("cognito:groups"[?@ == 'KrillAdmins'] | [0], '^.+$', 'admin')''' }
#
# For this to work you must already have configured in the AWS Cognito console
# a group called KrillAdmins and have added the logging in user to that group.
# Otherwise the "cognito:groups" claim will not be present in the ID token
# response issued by AWS Cognito. You also need to have set a "Sign Out URL" for
# in your AWS Cognito "App client settings" which should match the value you
# use for the "logout_uri" query parameter in the logout_url Krill setting.
#
# logout_url needs to be set because AWS Cognito doesn't advertise support for
# any of the OpenID Connect logout mechanisms that Krill understands.
#
# dddddddd should be replaced by your AWS Cognito domain prefix that you
# specified in hte AWS Cognito "App integration" -> "Domain name" console
# setting. The regions in the URLs should also match those that you are using.
#
# Note the use of ''' which is needed because the Cognito groups claim contains
# a colon which is a reserved character in JMESPath identifiers.
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Example Google Cloud Platform configuration:
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   [auth_openidconnect]
#   issuer_url = "https://accounts.google.com/.well-known/openid-configuration"
#   client_id = "xxxxxxxx.apps.googleusercontent.com"
#   client_secret = "yyyyyyyy"
#   extra_login_scopes = ["profile"]
#   
#   [auth_openidconnect.claims]
#   role = { jmespath='''recap(resub(picture, '^.+photo\.jpg$', 'admin'), '(admin)')''' }
#
# For this to work you must already have created Credentials in the Google
# developer console and have set the redirect URI to your Krill API
# /auth/callback public URL.
#
# In this example we have included the ".well-known/..." part of the issuer_url
# to demonstrate that Krill will accept the URL with or without it.
#
# ''' is used to ensure that characters in the regular expression don't conflict
# with JMESPath reserved characters. The JMESPath expression in this example is
# not a useful real world example as it grants "admin" rights to any Google
# account that has an associated picture whose URL ends in photo.jpg.
#
# The JMESPath expression in this example uses an outer recap() call to sanity
# check that the resulting role value is what we expect it to be. Without this
# a URL that doesn't match would pass straight through resub() unchanged. The
# recap() check is needed because you might use resub() to "clean up" values
# that in some cases don't need any cleaning and thus would still be wanted
# even though not modified.
#
# Also note that, while not visible in the configuration above, the GCP OpenID
# Connect provider advertizes an RFC 7009 OAuth 2.0 Token Revocation compatible
# `revocation_endpoint` which Krill will use to revoke the Google login token
# when the user logs out of Krill.
