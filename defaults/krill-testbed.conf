# Example Krill testbed configuration
#
# ************************* NOTE: ********************************
#
#       THIS ONLY MEANT TO BE USED FOR TESTING / TRAINING
#
# *****************************************************************
#
# With the disclaimer out of the way.. you can run Krill in testbed
# mode. If you do, then it will enable an embedded repository, and
# setup a trust anchor, and intermediate CA called 'testbed'.
#
# Furthermore the UI will expose where users can register their CA
# as a publisher under the embedded repository, and as a child under
# the testbed CA - claiming any resources they like to use for test
# purposes.
#
# You are going to need to do some general Krill configuration first.
# In particular: choose your 'admin_token' and 'data_dir' wisely..
# But feel free to review other settings as well.
#
# The testbed and repository are configured under the [testbed] section
# below. Note that the testbed will use an embedded publication server,
# so you should probably read up on the publication server section in
# our documentation. But note that a key difference is that in case of
# the testbed the public URIs for the publication server are configured
# in the config. This is needed so that Krill can automatically create
# and configure a Trust Anchor CA and 'testbed' CA below it.

# Admin Token
#
# Define an admin token that can be used to interact with the API. Token use
# is modelled after OAuth 2.0 Bearer Tokens (RFC 6750), which are expected be
# included as an HTTP header in requests by clients.
#
# If you do not specify a value here, the server will insist that you provide
# a token as an environment variable with the key "KRILL_ADMIN_TOKEN".
#
### admin_token =

# Specify the ip address and port number that the server will use.
#
# Note: we recommend that you do NOT change the IP address to anything other
# than 127.0.0.1. Please use a proxy server such as NGINX or apachee if you
# must make your Krill instance accessible remotely.
#
# If you do change the IP address, then you MUST also specify service_uri
# below.
#
### ip             = "127.0.0.1"
### port           = 3000

# Specify the base public service URI hostname and port.
#
# The default service URI is set to https://localhost:3000/. This is fine for
# setups where you use Krill to run your own CA only. You do not need to set this
# to enable remote access to # the UI or API (e.g. for using the CLI remotely).
# Simply setting up a proxy suffices for this.
#
# However, if you are serving as a parent CA or Publication Server that needs
# to be accessible by remote CAs, then you will need to tell your Krill instance
# what its public (base) URI will be, so that it can include the proper URIs
# in responses to those CAs.
#
# At present this MUST be an https URI with a hostname and optional port number only.
# It is not allowed to use a Krill specific path prefix. If you have a strong
# motivation for this, then please comment on the following github issue:
# https://github.com/NLnetLabs/krill/issues/263
#
# Krill UI, API and service URIs will be derived as follows:
#  <service_uri>api/v1/...                (api)
#  <service_uri>rfc6492                   (for remote children)

# To enable the testbed just add the following section to you config,
# and edit ALL settings - there are no defaults.

[testbed]

# RRDP BASE URI
#
# Set the base RRDP uri for the testbed repository server.
#
# It is highly recommended to use a proxy in front of Krill.
#
# To expose the RRDP files you can actually proxy back to your testbed
# krill server (https://<yourkrill>/rrdp/), or you can expose the
# files as they are written to disk ($data_dir/repo/rrdp/)
#
# Set the following value to *your* public proxy hostname and path.
rrdp_base_uri = "https://testbed.example.com/rrdp/"

# RSYNC BASE URI
#
# Set the base rsync URI (jail) for the testbed repository server.
#
# Make sure that you have an rsyncd running and a module which is
# configured to expose the rsync repository files. By default these
# files would be saved to: $data/repo/rsync/current/
rsync_jail = "rsync://testbed.example.com/repo/"

# TA AIA
#
# Set the rsync location for your testbed trust anchor certificate.
# 
# You need to configure an rsync server to expose another module for the
# TA certificate. Don't use the module for the repository as its
# content will be overwritten.
#
# Manually retrieve the TA certificate from krill and copy it
# over - it won't change again. You can get it at:
# https://<yourkrill>/ta/ta.cer
ta_aia = "rsync://testbed.example.com/ta/ta.cer"

# TA URI
#
# Like above, make the TA certificate available over HTTPS and
# specify the url here so that it may be included in the TAL.
ta_uri = "https://testbed.example.com/ta/ta.cer"
