# Specify the storage used by Krill.
#
# Currently, Krill supports disk based storage only.
#
# You can use a shared disk and a standby Krill node for redundancy.
# However, data corruption issues can occur if you run multiple active
# Krill nodes using a shared disk. Therefore, you MUST ensure that only
# one Krill node is active at any given time.
#
# Example configurations:
# storage_uri = "/var/lib/krill/data/"
#
# Default:
# storage_uri = "./data"
#
# For backward compatibility 'data_dir' is accepted as an
# alternative to 'storage_uri'.
#
### storage_uri = "./data"

# TLS Keys Dir
#
# Specify the location of the TLS directory for Krill's
# built-in HTTPS server. This MUST be set in case the
# storage_uri maps to a database.

# Default:
# tls_keys_dir = $storage_uri/ssl

# Repository Directory
#
# This is the directory used by the Krill Publication Server
# for the publication of RPKI objects.
#
# This defaults a directory called "repo" under your server's
# data directory. If your server uses a database for storage,
# this value MUST be set - even if you do not use Krill as a
# Publication Server. This will change when issues #1092 and
# #1093 are implemented.

#
# This MUST be set if a database is used. We will remove this
# when we implement issue #1094.

# upgrade_storage_uri = $data_dir/upgrade-data/

# History Cache
#
# Krill keeps meta-information on all past changes for each CA
# and the Publication Server. This information is cached by default
# to ensure that the history (audit log) API is fast.
#
# However, this data can add up over time, so operators of
# instances with many CAs or a lot of historical may choose
# to turn this off to save memory. Note that memory will still
# be used temporarily in case the history API is accessed.

# Admin Token
#
# Define an admin token that can be used to interact with the API. Token use
# is modelled after OAuth 2.0 Bearer Tokens (RFC 6750), which are expected be

#
# If you do not specify a value here, the server will insist that you provide
# a token as an environment variable with the key "KRILL_ADMIN_TOKEN".
#
### admin_token =

# Specify the ip addresses and port number that the server will use.
#
# Note: by default Krill uses "127.0.0.1" (IPv4 localhost) as its IP address.
# We recommend that you keep this setting and use a proxy server such as NGINX
# or Apache if you must make your Krill instance accessible remotely.
#
# You can use the 'ip' setting in this config file to override the default. You
# can specify a single IP address or an array of addresses.
#
# If you want to support remote delegated CAs to be children under a CA and/or
# publish their content, then you should set the "service uri" setting described
# below. If you do not set this, then Krill will use the (first) IP address as
# the hostname for this settting.
#
#
### ip             = "127.0.0.1"            # default
### ip             = [ "127.0.0.1", "::1" ] # multiple IP addresses
### port           = 3000                   # applies to all ip addresses

# Specify the HTTPS mode. Krill supports three modes:
#
# "generate" (DEFAULT)
#
# Krill will generate a key pair and create a self-signed certificate
# if no previous key pair or certificate is found. File names used
# are data_dir/ssl/key.pem and data_dir/ssl/cert.pem respectively.
#
# "existing"
#
# Krill expects an existing key pair and certificate in the same
# locations where it would otherwise store its generated key pair
# and self-signed certificate.
#
# "disable"
#
# Krill will use plain HTTP.
#
# This mode is not recommended as HTTPS adds little overhead, and
# even with a self-signed certificate provides better security
# out of the box.
#
# That said, if you are running an HTTPS proxy server on the same
# host as Krill and Krill is listening on localhost only, then
# using plain HTTP between Krill and your proxy server may be an
# option you would want to use.
#
# We recommend STRONGLY that you do not use this option if your
# Krill instance is configured to bind to a public IP address.
#
# **NOTE**: Even if you use "disable" here, Krill still insists on
#           using HTTPS for its service_uri. See below.
#
### https_mode = "generate"

# Specify the base public service URI hostname and port.
#
# The default service URI is set to https://localhost:3000/. This is fine for
# setups where you use Krill to run your own CA only. You do not need to set this
# to enable remote access to the UI or API (e.g. for using the CLI remotely).
# Simply setting up a proxy suffices for this.
#
# However, if you are serving as a parent CA or Publication Server that needs
# to be accessible by remote CAs, then you will need to tell your Krill instance
# what its public (base) URI will be, so that it can include the proper URIs
# in responses to those CAs.
#
# Note that Krill insists on HTTPS for this, even if you elect to use "disable"
# for the https_mode. The reason is that, while RFC 6492 (provisioning) and
# RFC 8181 (publication) allow for plain HTTP and provide security through
# signed messages, we believe it is better if this (remote) traffic is also
# encrypted and one can (and should) use an HTTPS capable proxy in this case.
#
# At present this MUST be an https URI with a hostname and optional port number only.
# It is not allowed to use a Krill specific path prefix. If you have a strong
# motivation for this, then please comment on the following github issue:
# https://github.com/NLnetLabs/krill/issues/263
#
# Krill UI, API and service URIs will be derived as follows:

#  <service_uri>rfc6492                   (for remote children)

#
#                               ROA Aggregation
#
# It is recommended that separate ROAs are used for each authorized prefix, even
# though the RFC allows for multiple prefixes for the same ASN to be combined on
# a single ROA object. The reason for this is that the ROA will become invalid
# if any of the listed prefixes no longer appears on your CA's certificate. Note
# that Krill will automatically clean up over-claiming ROAs when it finds that its
# resources have been shrunk, but there is a possible time window where ROAs can
# be invalid before Krill discovers the shrinkage.
#
# That said, if there would be too many ROAs then this will impact all RPKI
# validators, therefore Krill will by default start aggregating ROAs per ASN
# when more than 100 ROAs would be issued. Conversely, Krill will start de-
# aggregating again when the number of authorizations drops below 90.
#
# This behaviour can be overridden with the following directives:
# roa_aggregate_threshold = 100
# roa_deaggregate_threshold = 90


#
#                               Republication Intervals
#
# The RPKI uses Manifests (RFC 6486) to communicate the list of current RPKI
# objects (such as ROAs) to RPKI Validators. Manifests are used to protect against
# attacks, or incidents, where Validators only see a partial view of the RPKI
# repository. For this to work properly Validators will need to know how 'fresh'
# the Manifests are - otherwise they would be vulnerable to replay attacks where
# they are presented old versions of Manifests thus withholding them from discovering
# new RPKI objects.
#
# Krill issues manifests with a default next update and validity period of 24 hours,
# plus a random value between 0 and 4 hours. This random value is added in order to
# spread out scheduled next publication times between CAs.
#
# This means that the maximum replay window is 28 hours. Krill checks every 10 minutes
# whether the next update time is less then 8 hours (by default) in the future, and in
# that case it will re-issue them to avoid that Validators would end up with expired
# manifests. This means that an operator has a minimum of just under 8 hours to deal
# with issues with their CA or Publication Server before RPKI Validators would notice.
#
# The default values can be overridden, but with care.. make the next update interval
# too short and this causes too much work for all RPKI validators, puts load on your
# publication server and shortens your window to deal with issues. Make it too long
# and you could be vulnerable to replay attacks. Re-issue to quickly and again you
# cause extra load to RPKI validators and publication server.
#
# All that said.. if you are willing to accept the, in practice, small risk of a replay
# attack then you could for example opt for a 'timing_publish_next_hours' value of
# 48 hours, and a 'timing_publish_hours_before_next' value of 24 hours. That way you
# would have a full day to fix issues.
#
# timing_publish_next_hours = 24           # (must be 2 or higher)
# timing_publish_next_jitter_hours = 4     # must be 0 - timing_publish_next_hours / 2
# timing_publish_hours_before_next = 8     # (must be 1 or higher)


#
#                 ROA and Delegate Certificate Times
#
# Krill will issue ROAs, and child CA certificates if you have delegated resources
# to child CAs, with a "not after" time of 52 weeks from issuance, and it will
# re-issue those ROAs and certificates 4 weeks before they would expire.
#
# Because of the automatic renewal there should be no real need to use longer
# validity times. In fact using longer times could have a negative impact on
# Validator performance because the Certificate Revocation Lists would become
# bigger.
#
# So, we do NOT recommend overriding the following values, except perhaps for
# testing purposes:
# timing_child_certificate_valid_weeks = 52
# timing_child_certificate_reissue_weeks_before = 4
# timing_roa_valid_weeks = 52
# timing_roa_reissue_weeks_before = 4
