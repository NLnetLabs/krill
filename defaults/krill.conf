# Set the following to true to force Krill to always perform full rechecks
# of its data directories at startup. This is disabled by default because
# if can slow down startup significantly.
#
# By default Krill will do some basic checks at startup already, and if any
# errors are encountered force a full recovery automatically: Krill will try
# to load all its state in its internal memory cache at startup. If there are
# no errors in reloading the latest 'info' about the state, any surplus data
# will be assumed to be the result from an incompletely finished transaction - or -
# a data directory backup which was taken during a transaction. In either case
# additional data is discarded and the last (committed) state is recreated.
#
# Note that this 'recovery' will make Krill fall back to the last possible
# consistent state that it can. But, there may be important changes missing.
# For example any changes in ROAs made after the last recoverable state will
# be missing. You will have to verify the state yourself.
#
# In short: use this option only if you suspect that there is an issue with
# your backed up data. And if you do, you may want to set the ENV variable
# "KRILL_UPGRADE_ONLY" as well, in order to force that Krill exits after doing
# all its data checks and clean ups, and you have a chance to check the logs
# before proceeding.
#
### always_recover_data = false


#
#                               ROA Aggregation
#
# It is recommended that separate ROAs are used for each authorized prefix, even
# though the RFC allows for multiple prefixes for the same ASN to be combined on
# a single ROA object. The reason for this is that the ROA will become invalid
# if any of the listed prefixes no longer appears on your CA's certificate. Note
# that Krill will automatically clean up over-claiming ROAs when it finds that its
# resources have been shrunk, but there is a possible time window where ROAs can
# be invalid before Krill discovers the shrinkage.
#
# That said, if there would be too many ROAs then this will impact all RPKI
# validators, therefore Krill will by default start aggregating ROAs per ASN
# when more than 100 ROAs would be issued. Conversely, Krill will start de-
# aggregating again when the number of authorizations drops below 90.
#
# This behaviour can be overridden with the following directives:
# roa_aggregate_threshold = 100
# roa_deaggregate_threshold = 90


#
#                               Republication Intervals
#
# The RPKI uses Manifests (RFC 6486) to communicate the list of current RPKI
# objects (such as ROAs) to RPKI Validators. Manifests are used to protect against
# attacks, or incidents, where Validators only see a partial view of the RPKI
# repository. For this to work properly Validators will need to know how 'fresh'
# the Manifests are - otherwise they would be vulnerable to replay attacks where
# they are presented old versions of Manifests thus withholding them from discovering
# new RPKI objects.
#
# Krill issues manifests with a default next update and validity period of 24 hours,
# plus a random value between 0 and 4 hours. This random value is added in order to
# spread out scheduled next publication times between CAs.
#
# This means that the maximum replay window is 28 hours. Krill checks every 10 minutes
# whether the next update time is less then 8 hours (by default) in the future, and in
# that case it will re-issue them to avoid that Validators would end up with expired
# manifests. This means that an operator has a minimum of just under 8 hours to deal
# with issues with their CA or Publication Server before RPKI Validators would notice.
#
# The default values can be overridden, but with care.. make the next update interval
# too short and this causes too much work for all RPKI validators, puts load on your
# publication server and shortens your window to deal with issues. Make it too long
# and you could be vulnerable to replay attacks. Re-issue to quickly and again you
# cause extra load to RPKI validators and publication server.
#
# All that said.. if you are willing to accept the, in practice, small risk of a replay
# attack then you could for example opt for a 'timing_publish_next_hours' value of
# 48 hours, and a 'timing_publish_hours_before_next' value of 24 hours. That way you
# would have a full day to fix issues.
#
# timing_publish_next_hours = 24           # (must be 2 or higher)
# timing_publish_next_jitter_hours = 4     # must be 0 - timing_publish_next_hours / 2
# timing_publish_hours_before_next = 8     # (must be 1 or higher)


#
#                 ROA and Delegate Certificate Times
#
# Krill will issue ROAs, and child CA certificates if you have delegated resources
# to child CAs, with a "not after" time of 52 weeks from issuance, and it will
# re-issue those ROAs and certificates 4 weeks before they would expire.
#
# Because of the automatic renewal there should be no real need to use longer
# validity times. In fact using longer times could have a negative impact on
# Validator performance because the Certificate Revocation Lists would become
# bigger.
#
# So, we do NOT recommend overriding the following values, except perhaps for
# testing purposes:
# timing_child_certificate_valid_weeks = 52
# timing_child_certificate_reissue_weeks_before = 4
# timing_roa_valid_weeks = 52
# timing_roa_reissue_weeks_before = 4
