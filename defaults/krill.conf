# Specify how to set up the HTTPS certificate for Krill
#   existing: Expects an existing certificate and key in $data_dir/ssl
#   generate: Will generate a new key-pair and self-signed cert if
#             they cannot be found in $data_dir/ssl
#
# Note: we strongly recommend that you use a proxy like nginx, apache, or
# <your-choice-here> for HTTPS on a public network.
#
### https_mode = "generate"

# Specify the ip address and port number that the server will use.
#
# Note: we recommend that you use the defaults and use a proxy if you
# must make your Krill instance accessible remotely.
#
### ip             = "localhost"
### port           = 3000

# Specify the directory where the publication server will store its data.
# Note that clustering through a shared data directory is not supported.
# But, we plan to look into a proper clustering solution later.
#
### data_dir = "./data"

# Specify the path to the PID file for Krill.
#
# Defaults to "krill.pid" under the 'data_dir' specified above.
#
### pid_file = "./data/krill.pid"


# Specify whether an embedded repository should be started. For many users
# it will be better to use a repository server provided by a third party, e.g.
# the RIR or NIR under which resources are received.
#
# Note that an existing embedded repository server will be removed if this
# setting is set to 'false' (default) AND there are no current publishers (i.e.
# all CAs use an external repository).
#
### repo_enabled = false

# Specify the base rsync repository for this server. Publishers will get
# a base URI that is based on the 'publisher_handle' in the XML file.
#
# Note, you should set up an rsync daemon to expose $data_dir/rsync to serve
# this data. The uri defined here should match the module name in your rsync
# configuration.
#
# Furthemore.. note that the default 'localhost' is only allowed to be used
# when the KRILL_TEST ENV variable has been set.
#
### rsync_base = "rsync://localhost/repo/"

# Specify the base public URI to this service. Other URIs will be derived
# from this:
#  <BASE_URI>api/v1/...                (api)
#  <BASE_URI>rfc8181                   (for remote publishers)
#  <BASE_URI>rfc6492                   (for remote children)
#  <BASE_URI>rrdp/..                   (override with rddp_service_uri)
#  <BASE_URI>ta/ta.cer                 (on TAL for embedded TA)
#
# MUST end with a slash.
#
# Note that the default service URI is set to https://localhost:3000/ regardless of
# the IP and port configured above (but matching their default).
#
# This service URI is fine for simple setups where you use Krill to run your own CA
# only and you use the CLI from localhost.
#
# However, if you need to access Krill remotely then make sure that you use a public
# URI here *and* make sure that you use a proxy server with a proper HTTPS certificate
# in front of Krill.
#
### service_uri = "https://localhost:3000/"

# Use the following if you want to use another public URI to access the RRDP files,
# e.g. because you serve them as raw files from another machine with a web server.
#
### rrdp_service_uri = "$service_uri/rrdp/"

# Log level
#
# The maximum log level ("off", "error", "warn", "info", or "debug") for
# which to log messages.
#
# Defaults to "warn"
#
### log_level = "warn"

# Log type
#
# Where to log to. One of "stderr" for stderr, "syslog" for syslog, or "file"
# for a file. If "file" is given, the "log_file" field needs to be given, too.
#
### log_type = "file"

# Syslog facility
#
# The syslog facility to log to if syslog logging is used. Defaults to "daemon".
#
### syslog_facility = "daemon"

# Log file
#
# The path to the file to log to if file logging is used. If the path is
# relative, it is relative to the current working directory from which
# the binary is executed.
#
### log_file = "./krill.log"

# Master Authorization Bearer Token
#
# Define a master token that can be used to interact with the API. Token use
# is modelled after OAuth 2.0 Bearer Tokens (RFC 6750), which are expected be
# included as an HTTP header in requests by clients.
#
# If you do not specify a value here, the server will insist that you provide
# a token as an environment variable with the key "KRILL_AUTH_TOKEN".
#
### auth_token =

# CA certificate refresh rate
#
# This defines the rate, in seconds, for Krill CAs to to contact their parent
# CA and query for updates in resource entitlements.

# Defaults to 10 minutes

### ca_refresh = 600

# Restrict size of messages sent to the API

# Default 256 kB
#
### post_limit_api = 262144

#
### post_limit_rfc8181 = 33554432

# Specify a log directory for logging RFC 8181 (publication protocol)
# exchanges. If this directive is set Krill will log all meaningful
# RFC 8181 exchanges in this directory, meaning exchanges that resulted
# in a change or an error.
#
# If this directive is not specified, Krill will NOT log these exchanges.

#
# Defaults to NO logging!
#
### rfc8181_log_dir = </some/path>

# Restrict size of messages sent to the RFC 6492 up-down protocol
#
# Default 1MB (enough for a keyroll with certs of ~400kb, the biggest known cert is 220kB)
#
### post_limit_rfc6492 = 1048576

# Specify a log directory for logging RFC 6492 (up-down protocol)
# exchanges. If this directive is set Krill will log all meaningful
