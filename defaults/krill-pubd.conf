#
# RRDP DELTA FILES
#
# The RRDP protocol uses deltas to allow Relying Parties to synchronise efficiently.
# If Relying Parties cannot retrieve deltas, they will fall back to using snapshots.
# The RRDP protocol specifies that no more deltas should be presented than the total
# size of the snapshot. However, it is good to limit the amount of deltas further than
# this because:
#  1) big notification files are expensive to serve and parse
#  2) it's not just size, because of latency parsing many small deltas may
#     be more time consuming than falling back to a delta
#
# So, the objective would be to optimize things such that the notification.xml files
# remain relatively small, while still allowing the vast majority of Relying Party
# implementations to use deltas, under normal operations.
#
# We use the following strategy to prune excessive deltas:
#
#  - never keep more than the size of the snapshot
#  - always keep 'rrdp_delta_files_min_nr' files
#  - always keep 'rrdp_delta_files_min_seconds' files
#  - beyond this:
#    - never keep more than 'rrdp_delta_files_max_nr'
#    - never keep older than 'rrdp_delta_files_max_seconds'
#    - keep the others
#
# With these defaults:
# rrdp_delta_files_min_nr = 5
# rrdp_delta_files_min_seconds = 1200 
#    \- (20 mins: twice the interval of commonly used RPs)
# rrdp_delta_files_max_seconds = 7200
#    \- (2 hours: twice the interval of slowest RPs)
# rrdp_delta_files_max_nr = 50

# Furthermore, you may choose to limit the RRDP deltas interval. If this value is set, then
# RRDP deltas will be produced no more frequently than the specified interval. If the server
# is quiet, then typically the first update sent to it will result in an RRDP update straightaway.
# But, if the server is busy, then subsequent updates will be held until the interval period has
# passed since the last RRDP update.
#
# By default every change gets its own RRDP delta. But on systems with many publishers it is
# a good idea to limit the amount of deltas a bit. E.g. for a system with 5000 CAs with 20 ROAs
# each a higher interval is needed - otherwise the system will be too busy writing large snapshot
# files and essentially won't be able to handle the (normal, mft/crl renewal) publication load.
#
# Since Relying Party software (validators, such as Routinator) use update intervals in the order
# of 10 minutes, there is no problem in limiting the delta interval to a couple of minutes.
#
# rrdp_delta_interval_min_seconds = 0

# Optionally archive - rather than delete - old snapshot and delta files. They can then be backed
# up and/deleted at the repository operator's discretion. This may be particularly useful for
# audit or research.
#
# If set to true files will be archived in a directory under '$data_dir/repo/archive'

# Set the following to true to force Krill to always perform full rechecks
# of its data directories at startup. This is disabled by default because
# if can slow down startup significantly.
#
# By default Krill will do some basic checks at startup already, and if any
# errors are encountered force a full recovery automatically: Krill will try
# to load all its state in its internal memory cache at startup. If there are
# no errors in reloading the latest 'info' about the state, any surplus data
# will be assumed to be the result from an incompletely finished transaction - or -
# a data directory backup which was taken during a transaction. In either case
# additional data is discarded and the last (committed) state is recreated.
#
# Note that when a Krill Publication Server performs a recovery it will also
# execute an RRDP session reset. This ensures that relying parties will get
# a full and consistent set of data, even if this data may be old. Furthermore,
# Krill CAs will *always* verify with their Publication Server which files it
# publishes currently, and if it finds that there are any missing files they
# will send all needed updates.
#
# So, while a (forced) fallback to a prior state is not ideal, the CAs will
# in fact recover. However, it may take a while
