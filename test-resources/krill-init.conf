#                               ROA Aggregation
#
# It is recommended that separate ROAs are used for each authorized prefix, even
# though the RFC allows for multiple prefixes for the same ASN to be combined on
# a single ROA object. The reason for this is that the ROA will become invalid
# if any of the listed prefixes no longer appears on your CA's certificate. Note
# that Krill will automatically clean up over-claiming ROAs when it finds that its
# resources have been shrunk, but there is a possible time window where ROAs can
# be invalid before Krill discovers the shrinkage.
#
# That said, if there would be too many ROAs then this will impact all RPKI
# validators, therefore Krill will by default start aggregating ROAs per ASN
# when more than 100 ROAs would be issued. Conversely, Krill will start de-
# aggregating again when the number of authorizations drops below 90.
#
# This behaviour can be overridden with the following directives:
# roa_aggregate_threshold = 100
# roa_deaggregate_threshold = 90


#
#                               Republication Intervals
#
# The RPKI uses Manifests (RFC 6486) to communicate the list of current RPKI
# objects (such as ROAs) to RPKI Validators. Manifests are used to protect against
# attacks, or incidents, where Validators only see a partial view of the RPKI
# repository. For this to work properly Validators will need to know how 'fresh'
# the Manifests are - otherwise they would be vulnerable to replay attacks where
# they are presented old versions of Manifests thus withholding them from discovering
# new RPKI objects.
#
# Manifests have two important dates included in them:
# 1- the 'next update time'
# 2- an expiration time
#
# When the next update time is passed manifests will become 'stale'. This means
# the Validators may either warn about the objects listed in these manifests, or
# they may even reject these objects altogether. There is current discussion about
# aligning this behaviour in the IETF - but for the moment the outcome will vary
# between Validator implementations.
#
# When the expiration time (not after time on the embedded EE certificate of the
# Manifest) passes, then the Manifest will be considered invalid by all Validator
# implementations.
#
# So, if Validators are subject to replay attacks of Manifests they will be
# unaware until these times have passed. After these times the Manifest and all
# listed RPKI objects will become invalid. When ROA objects become invalid, this
# typically means that the Route Announcement will be considered "Not Found", rather
# than invalid. So, typically they would not be dropped, but they are no longer
# protected by RPKI.
#
# One could therefore argue that short times should be used. However, if the times
# chosen are too short, then this will leave your CA vulnerable to possible
# operational issues with its RPKI repository - or outages of your CA itself.
#
# So, in short, the chosen values are a balance between the wish to limit the
# vulnerability to replay attacks vs the time an operator has to solve operational
# issues.
#
# Krill uses the following defaults:
#
# The "next update" time is 24 hours:
# timing_publish_next_hours = 24
#
# The "not after time" on the EE certificate is 7 days from issuance:
# timing_publish_valid_days = 7
#
# Krill will automatically re-publish new Manifests if they would become stale
# in 8 hours. Because re-publication happens hourly, this leaves the operator
# with a minimum of 7 hours to fix issues if re-publication should fail.
# timing_publish_hours_before_next = 8


#
#                 ROA and Delegate Certificate Times
#
# Krill will issue ROAs, and child CA certificates if you have delegated resources
# to child CAs, with a "not after" time of 52 weeks from issuance, and it will
# re-issue those ROAs and certificates 4 weeks before they would expire.
#
# Because of the automatic renewal there should be no real need to use longer
# validity times. In fact using longer times could have a negative impact on
# Validator performance because the Certificate Revocation Lists would become
# bigger.
#
# So, we do NOT recommend overriding the following values, except perhaps for
# testing purposes:
# timing_child_certificate_valid_weeks = 52
# timing_child_certificate_reissue_weeks_before = 4
# timing_roa_valid_weeks = 52
# timing_roa_reissue_weeks_before = 4
