# START DEBIAN PACKAGING
#
# Configurations for the cargo-deb cargo plugin which builds Debian packages in
# target/debian/ when invoked with: cargo deb. Tested with cargo-deb v1.23.1.
# Use `--variant` to select which section below to use. Variant sections inherit
# and override the settings in the base [package.metadata.deb] section. The
# configs vary because of differing degrees of OpenSSL and systemd support
# across operating systems.
#
# Note that as the postinst script uses the adduser command we declare a
# dependency on the adduser package to keep the lintian tool happy.
# Note: krill.conf is deliberately NOT specified as a "conf-file" because it is
# generated.
#
# The GitHub Actions pkg.yml workflow definition file uses these configurations
# to build and test Ubuntu/Debian packages for Krill.
#

# Variant of the Debian packaging configuration that:
#   a) statically links with OpenSSL when building a Debian package because the
#      newest OpenSSL available on Ubuntu 16.04 at the time of writing is 1.0.2g
#      (see: https://packages.ubuntu.com/xenial/openssl) while Krill requires
#      OpenSSL >= 1.1.0.
#   b) uses a simpler systemd service unit file because Ubuntu 16.04 doesn't
#      support newer features supported by Ubuntu 18.04 and 20.04.
