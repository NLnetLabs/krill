Krill is a free, open source RPKI Certificate Authority that lets you run
delegated RPKI under one or multiple Regional Internet Registries (RIRs).
Through its built-in publication server, Krill can publish Route Origin
Authorisations (ROAs) on your own servers or with a third party.

This package contains the krillup tool which can be used to reduce the
risk and time needed for Krill upgrades, by preparing and verifying any
data migrations that would be needed.
