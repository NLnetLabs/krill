Krill is a free, open source RPKI Certificate Authority that lets you run
delegated RPKI under one or multiple Regional Internet Registries (RIRs).
Through its built-in publication server, Krill can publish Route Origin
Authorisations (ROAs) on your own servers or with a third party.

This package contains the krillup binary for handling data migrations
for particularly large deployments or other special cases. Most users
shouldn't need to use this package.
