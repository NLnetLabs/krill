  # custom build arguments instead.

  # CentOS 8 became EOL and is in theory still usable as a build container as there is still a Docker image
  # available, and package installation can be done by switching the yum config in the container to use packages
  # from the CentOS 8 vault rather than the now offline actual CentOS 8 repository. However, due to experiencing
  # lots of timed out connections to the vault we will build the CentOS 8 compatible package in a Rocky Linux
  # container instead, as Rocky Linux is 100% compatible with CentOS 8. The server at packages.nlnetlabs.nl
  # however has a repo for CentOS 8, not Rocky Linux, and determines the repo to publish in based on the name of
  # the archive that we produce below which is in turn based by default on the container image used to build. We
  # therefore in this case need to specify that the O/S we are building for has a different name than the Docker
  # image we are building it in.
