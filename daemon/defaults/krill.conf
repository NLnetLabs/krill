# Specify whether https is to be used instead of plain http. Allowed values are
# "no", "yes" and "test". Defaults to "no".
#
# "no"   : Plain HTTP will be used.
# "yes"  : The server will look for a 'cert.pem' and 'key.pem' file, under the
#          'ssl' sub-folder of the 'data_dir' specified below.
# "test" : The server will generate a key pair and a long-lived self-signed
#          certificate if no 'cert.pem' or 'key.pem' file can be found.

# Note, we recommend that you use "test" only in real test environments, and
# that you use an industry proven HTTPS proxy (apache, nginx, etc) for
# production environments.

#

#
# Where to log to. One of "stderr" for stderr, "syslog" for syslog, or "file"

#
# The syslog facility to log to if syslog logging is used. Defaults to "daemon".

# Master Authorization Bearer Token

# Define a master token that can be used to interact with the API. Token use
# is modelled after OAuth 2.0 Bearer Tokens (RFC 6750), which are expected be
# included as an HTTP header in requests by clients.

# If you do not specify a value here, the server will insist that you provide
# a token as an environment variable with the key "KRILL_AUTH_TOKEN".
