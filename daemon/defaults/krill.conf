#
# "no"   : Plain HTTP will be used.
# "yes"  : The server will look for a 'cert.pem' and 'key.pem' file, under the
#          'ssl' sub-folder of the 'data_dir' specified below.
# "test" : The server will generate a key pair and a long-lived self-signed
#          certificate if no 'cert.pem' or 'key.pem' file can be found.
